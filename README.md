# Text Classification Pytorch

The main goal of this project is to implement various models to classify textual data using Pytorch

## Models

1. CNN:

  - https://github.com/prakashpandey9/Text-Classification-Pytorch/blob/master/models/CNN.py

## Requirements

You will have to install `miniconda`, for that use [following instruction](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Once you have installed miniconda, run following commands to set up local virtual `text-classification-pytorch` environment

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
`conda activate text-classification-pytorch`
